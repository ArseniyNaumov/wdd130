                Diagrams (ERD) in MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE was more than just a course—it resonated with a part of me that
                existed even before formal study. As a visual learner, crafting ERDs became an innate pleasure, a
                natural extension of my thought process.
                <br>
                <br>
                The joy of translating abstract concepts into tangible structures, of reverse and forward engineering
                ERDs, and of populating databases from the ground up with code was an experience that felt like an
                intrinsic part of who I am. Beyond the technicalities, writing queries adorned with joins, orders,
                groups, and path functions became a creative endeavor—a symphony of logic and design.
                <br>
                <br>
                ERDs ceased to be a mere coursework requirement; they became a canvas through which I expressed my
                understanding of data relationships. It was a delightful exploration of form and function, where each
                line of code felt like a stroke of a paintbrush, bringing a complex, interconnected world to life.
                <br>
                <br>
                In essence, ERD creation wasn't just a skill I acquired—it was a passion that had found its medium. The
                process of transforming abstract ideas into visually comprehensible structures was a journey that
                resonated deeply with my visual learning style, making every step of it a genuine pleasure.

                <br><br>
                Throughout my professional journey, I have served as a business assistant to various entities, including
                a Private Computer Fixing agency in 2008, a Tooth Technician workshop in 2011-12, a Retail establishment
                from 2012-14, and to a Warehouse manager from 2017-18. During these roles, I actively initiated and
                managed several projects, demonstrating my capacity for innovation and leadership. Notably, from
                2018-2020, I served as an Assistant to a Small Startup, Barter Alahona Company in Ufa, Russia. In this
                role, I played a pivotal part in driving the success of creating a clothing store from scratch,
                achieving an impressive $10,000 in revenue within just 7 months.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Between 2014 and 2016, I served as a specialist in the customer service complaint division, honing my
                skills in the delicate art of human interaction within both corporate environments and client
                interactions. Subsequently, during my tenure at Barter Alahona Company from 2018 to 2020, I faced and
                adeptly
                managed some of the most challenging cases involving client fraud, deception, legal issues, and
                interpersonal conflicts. Despite navigating through situations reminiscent of my experiences in the
                Navy, characterized by swearing and dishonesty, I consistently upheld the high standards of behavior and
                speech dictated by the principles of the LDS community.
                <br><br>
                In addition to mitigating complex external challenges, I played a crucial role in internal affairs.
                Trusted by my colleagues, I made decisions on matters ranging from negotiating the return of erroneously
                paid salaries with employees to conducting internal investigations and contributing to human resources
                decisions.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my career, I have embraced a philosophy of unwavering loyalty to my employers. My commitment
                to loyalty has been a constant thread in my professional journey. Notably, my departure from every
                position has been characterized by dignity and amicable relations. In each transition, I sought
                environments where I could contribute for the long term, emphasizing the importance of enduring service
                and fostering positive relationships with both immediate colleagues and leadership.
                <br><br>
                My ability to stand out in the workforce is grounded in my steadfast loyalty to the companies, brands,
                and leadership personalities I have served. It is this commitment that has consistently distinguished
                me, creating a lasting impact on my professional trajectory.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Since the age of 14, when I became a member of the LDS community, I have cherished the opportunity to
                speak in front of audiences. This exposure has played a pivotal role in almost completely overcoming any
                fear of public speaking. Armed with a clear outline, bullet points, relevant quotes, and a timekeeping
                watch, I am proficient in delivering both persuasive and informative speeches. Drawing on the best
                convincing techniques, I exercise control over audience attention while leveraging effective listening
                skills.
                <br><br>
                While I may not be a fervent advocate of sales, I do possess experience in this domain. When I am
                well-versed in the topic of my speech, my passion for preparation ignites. I meticulously choose my
                words in all three languages I am proficient in, create engaging presentation slides and handouts, and
                craft a compelling and immersive experience for every listener. My ability to quickly become passionate
                about a subject ensures that I can captivate an audience and leave a lasting impact.
