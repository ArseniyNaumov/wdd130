        <h2>Uncompromising approach <br>
            to value creation</h2>
        <h3>Even in the process of studying the task, I keep track of conflicting, mutually exclusive requirements, then
            comes the most pleasant part: my whole being screams that all requirements must be met absolutely,
            100%, and I am constantly looking for ways, tools, methods and technologies that were previously
            underestimated by others, in order to create an uncompromising product that surpasses the heritage
            of humanity.<br><br>
            Born in Ukraine, educated at the Ural State Technical University (Yekaterinburg, Russia), and now at the
            Brigham Young University - Idaho,
            I live in Texas, not far from Houston. Javascript is in the process of learning, and PHP is scheduled
            for the next year. </h3>
