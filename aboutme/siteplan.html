            This section will include my photo and short paragraph that reflenct my attitude towards web-design:
            <br>
            <br>
            "Even in the process of studying the task, I keep track of conflicting, mutually exclusive requirements,
            then
            comes the most pleasant part: my whole being screams that all requirements must be met absolutely,
            100%, and I am constantly looking for ways, tools, methods and technologies that were previously
            underestimated by others, in order to create an uncompromising product that surpasses the heritage
            of humanity.
            Born in Ukraine, educated at the Ural State Technical University (Yekaterinburg, Russia), and now at the
            Brigham Young University - Idaho,
            I live in Texas, not far from Houston. Javascript is in the process of learning, and PHP is scheduled
            for the next year."
            <br>
            <br>
            This personal website stands as a symbol of my unwavering commitment to web development. It's a
            versatile resource for employers, a platform for fellow web enthusiasts, and a continuous journey of
            personal growth. As I expand into JavaScript and other advanced technologies, the website will evolve to
            reflect my growing expertise.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's more than just a project; it's a window into my passion for web development. I extend an open
            invitation to everyone, regardless of your background or interests, to explore, learn, and be part of my
            journey in the ever-evolving world of web development. Welcome to my digital home.
