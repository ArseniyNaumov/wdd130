            This section will include my photo and short paragraph that reflenct my attitude towards web-design:

            "Even in the process of studying the task, I keep track of conflicting, mutually exclusive requirements,
            then
            comes the most pleasant part: my whole being screams that all requirements must be met absolutely,
            100%, and I am constantly looking for ways, tools, methods and technologies that were previously
            underestimated by others, in order to create an uncompromising product that surpasses the heritage
            of humanity.
            Born in Ukraine, educated at the Ural State Technical University (Yekaterinburg, Russia), and now at the
            Brigham Young University - Idaho,
            I live in Texas, not far from Houston. Javascript is in the process of learning, and PHP is scheduled
            for the next year."

            Lower there will be some other text, this is the draft

            "In the dynamic world of web development, creating a personal website has emerged as a significant
            milestone, especially for aspiring developers. Welcome to my personal website, a project developed during
            the WDD130 course that goes far beyond a simple assignment. It serves multiple purposes and is tailored to
            address a diverse range of visitors, making it a valuable resource for potential employers, web enthusiasts,
            and my own continuous learning journey.

            For Potential Employers:

            For potential employers and recruiters, my personal website acts as a comprehensive digital portfolio that
            highlights my proficiency in HTML and CSS. As a testament to my commitment to becoming a proficient web
            developer, this platform will soon incorporate JavaScript and other advanced technologies.

            Here, you can find a well-structured HTML and CSS combination that creates a visually appealing and
            user-friendly experience. It showcases my ability to design and construct web pages, manage layout and
            design, and effectively implement CSS to enhance the overall aesthetics of a website. My resume, bio,
            photos, and a comprehensive list of my skills, along with fair evaluations of my proficiency in each area,
            are readily available for your assessment.

            For Web Enthusiasts and Peers:

            This website is more than just a portfolio. It's a living testament to my passion for web development and a
            reflection of my journey from a beginner to a proficient developer. It's an open invitation to my fellow web
            enthusiasts and peers who share the same enthusiasm for web development. Explore my ongoing improvements and
            witness my growth in real-time.

            For My Personal Growth:

            For my personal growth as a web developer, this website serves as a dynamic library of my HTML and CSS
            knowledge. It's not just a static display; it's a canvas for continuous improvement. With each new function
            or rule I learn, I update the source code here. As I embark on the WDD230 course in the next semester and
            delve into JavaScript, this platform will adapt to incorporate interactive elements, dynamic content, and
            enhanced user experiences.

            As I continue my education and professional journey, I can always refer back to the source code on my
            website to revisit and apply the techniques and concepts I've mastered. It becomes a personalized repository
            of my growth, and I'm excited to have you along for the ride.

            In Conclusion:

            In conclusion, my personal website stands as a symbol of my unwavering commitment to web development. It's a
            versatile resource for employers, a platform for fellow web enthusiasts, and a continuous journey of
            personal growth. As I expand into JavaScript and other advanced technologies, the website will evolve to
            reflect my growing expertise.

            It's more than just a project; it's a window into my passion for web development. I extend an open
            invitation to everyone, regardless of your background or interests, to explore, learn, and be part of my
            journey in the ever-evolving world of web development. Welcome to my digital home.
