                <p class="description">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
                    Salmon
                    river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people
                    living
                    near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
                    rugged
                    beauty
                    of the river that they never left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                    also
                    commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
                    tower
                    over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                    undammed
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder
                    in
                    the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                    summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's
                    slower,
                    warmer water more.

                <p class="description">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
                    land
                    anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey
                    stone
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
                    trip
                    runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
                    outstanding
                    scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human
                    activity,
                    and great whitewater opportunities.

                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on
                    the
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <p class="description">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
                    river
                    trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                    one
                    truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
                    whitewater
                    rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
                    variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so
                    we
                    often refer to both.
